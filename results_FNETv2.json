        "original": "Who’s responsible for Blizzard Entertainment’s string of money-minting video games? Meet Paul Sams, the chief operating officer of Blizzard, now a division of Activision Blizzard, the gaming powerhouse created from the $18 billion merger in 2007 of Activision and Vivendi Games.\nHe’s one of the top executives responsible for making sure Blizzard keeps pumping out hits like World of Warcraft, which has 12-million-plus paying subscribers. This year, Blizzard celebrated its 20th anniversary (see the company’s own retrospective here), and 2010 was its biggest financial success in its history, thanks to the launches of World of Warcraft Cataclysm and StarCraft II. By far, World of Warcraft is the most successful game in Blizzard’s history; author Jane McGonigal says gamers have collectively played about 5.93 million years of WoW. WoW players put in about 30 million hours a day.\nBlizzard continues to work on ground-breaking titles, including Diablo III, a new StarCraft expansion, and a secret massively multiplayer online game called Project Titan. But the competitive environment around it is changing. Lots of game companies are diving into free-to-play games, where users play for free and pay small amounts of real money for virtual goods. Companies such as Microsoft are diving into this business model for online games with titles such as Age of Empires Online. Electronic Arts will also challenge Blizzard with a Star Wars MMO this year and Trion Worlds has recently launched its fantasy MMO, Rift, in direct competition with WoW. There isn’t any real danger yet. But at some point, those games could conceivably threaten World of Warcraft’s base of paying subscribers.\nHere’s our Q&A with Sams, and read here for our previous Q&A with Sams.\nVB: So what are your observations about Blizzard’s 20th anniversary?\nPS: Back in the early days, we didn’t think 20 years out into the future. We didn’t think it was possible to have the type of success we have been fortunate enough to have. But when I sit back and I reflect on these two decades, it’s been an incredible ride for us. We’ve maintained our core mission of making the most out of our games. We focus on making the most epic entertainment experiences ever, and I think we’ve really stuck with our values. It drives our decisions and has allowed us to provide a level of consistency in what we’ve been able to deliver. We have been able to make many of the top-selling PC games in the world for many years.\nIt’s tough to run a successful company for 20 years. We are very proud and humbled by it.\nVB: How many people are working for you?\nPS: We’ve got around 5,000 globally. We’ve got offices in Irvine, Calif., which is our global headquarters. Our U.S. call center is out in Austin. We’ve got about 800 people there. Then we’ve got our offices just outside of Paris and the European main call center is in Cork, Ireland. And then when you get over to Asia, we’ve got Shanghai, Taipei, Singapore and other places. A lot of good things have come from having a global presence.\nOne of our company values is to think globally, so we’ve really done that and I think we were truly the first company in the game space that did global launches. And when I say global launches, I don’t mean just U.S. and Europe. I mean Japan. I mean Asia. There is really no other company that’s really done that and there is no other company that has been able to reach top position regardless of company in each of those markets.\nVB: I would guess there are very few surviving game companies that were started about the same time yours was.\nPS: They’ve all either gone away or they’ve been acquired. Our average senior executive tenure is over 15 years. So we’ve got our same management and even if we’ve gone through a number of transitions with various parent companies or sister companies over the last couple of decades, we’ve been able to maintain our identity. We’ve been able to maintain control of our business and the decision-making over what products we make and when we release them and how big or small they are and what audiences we reach. So we’ve been very fortunate, and I think the reason we’ve been fortunate is because we’ve consistently been able to deliver the results.\nVB: And nobody messes with the golden goose.\nPS: I think that’s true when you are performing the way that we have, thankfully, been able to continue to perform. It doesn’t make a lot of sense to mess with that. We’ve been fortunate that, with each of the parties we’ve been involved with, we’ve been able to convince them through our actions and our results that they really should be focusing in other parts of the business and not on us because we are going to deliver what we promise.\nVB: I remember when you folks talked at the Dice Summit about how many games Blizzard had developed by decided not to ship over the years. That said a lot about your stance on quality control.\nPS: There is a huge number of those games.\nVB: You are brutal on yourselves that way.\nPS: I will tell you something. When you look at our brand, players support us and trust us. From our perspective, you get very few opportunities to build that trust, to keep that trust, and if you deliver a game that does not meet their expectations and it’s just okay, it’s acceptable, well then you breach that trust. We are very thankful to have the players that support us. They consistently vote with their pocket books that we are fulfilling their expectations and their wants and dreams as it relates to games. And we are very mindful about what those people feel about us, what they think about our games and whether or not we’ve addressed their wants and needs. We are very connected with them. We’ve got a few thousand customer service people. I think we have the largest service group of any video game company in the world.\nVB: How many developers do you have?\nPS: It’s less than 1,000 of the 5,000 who are in development. The rest are service as well as headquarters and the other functions that you anticipate like in PR. So we have the largest number of community team members of any game company out there. We listen to our players intently, and we really try to be focused on delivering what they are asking for. We are on the forums, we read every post, we get tons of petitions and contacts. All of those pieces of information come in we break down to bite-sized actionable chunks. We deliver this intelligence to the applicable people so they can effectively address concerns and issues quickly. We do make mistakes, and we hope we learn from them faster.\nVB: So what do you think of the word “disruption” when it comes to the video game industry. Will subscription gaming be disrupted?\nPS: It might and it might not. I will tell you that with very few exceptions, most games don’t have the life cycle to last as a subscription game. If you look at the historically most successful subscription games, World of Warcraft is at the top. We are continuing to grow that game in our seventh year. You look at games like Lineage in Asia, they continue to be chart toppers. Those are subscription-based games. If you look at some of the other more item-focused games, with the virtual goods models, they don’t last as long. Those are the games that tend to have four sequels because they’ve got to do something new to compel those players to keep playing.\nAs it relates to free to play, I do think that is an interesting business model. But it is not going to allow those companies to create the type of complexity and experience that a subscription-based title like World of Warcraft can have. The fact of the matter is, the companies that make high-quality games have to have monetary backing and they have to be able to generate revenue that covers the costs of initial and ongoing development.\nWe have these recurring revenue streams, which allows us to invest and to provide experiences and services to our players unlike any other company. The free-to-play games have to go about trying to find other revenue streams, and those revenue streams are inherently smaller. That means the game development budgets are inherently smaller. That is not to say you cannot have an awesome free-to-play game that costs less to make. There are lots of examples of those successful games. I do think that with the free-to-play games you may reach audiences that you don’t traditionally reach with the subscription games. That makes sense because you are not going to find a lot of casual first-time gamers signing up for a $15 a month subscription.\nThe free-to-play games serve an important role. Like the theme parks that compete with Disneyland. You can go see all of those experiences, and then you will come and do it all with us. We are going to create the most immersive experience and the most engaging, deep experiences. That is because we can put a big budget behind our efforts that the free-to-play games can’t match. I like these other games personally and I dig the fact that small development teams can work on games again. There was a period of time that was not possible because the budgets had gotten so big.\nNow we can see small groups making mobile and iPad games. That is positive for us. That means a lot of developers can spread their wings and build new kinds of games. We want them to graduate to doing bigger games, and we hope to draw from them from a talent perspective.\nWe are always looking for the best and brightest people to hire. There was a time when it was harder to find independent garage teams. We had to expand to other countries and recruit beyond areas we had gone to before just to tap the talent pool.\nNow there are all these people who love games. Maybe they don’t have the experience and capability to come work for one of the big companies yet. They may also say, screw it, we’re are going to do this ourselves. And they do these smaller things, they see some success, they start getting the budgets to do more, and they produce cooler stuff. Then they do have experience that is applicable to our games.\nVB: What is your thinking about when to do a new game instead of continuously refining your older game? When do you do the next MMO?\nPS: We have another MMO that I don’t think we’ve been talking about.\nVB: Project Titan, right? Based on the leaked schedule.\nPS: We will just talk about “the project” [meaning he won’t acknowledge the leaked code name].\nVB: Yeah, so how do you decide that?\nPS: We intend to do more expansions too. There is no change in our thinking. We intend absolutely positively to continue to support the existing World of Warcraft product. There are over 12 million global paying subscribers that are active in our game. We are not going to turn our back on them and we intend to continue to support that franchise for many many years to come. As to our new unannounced game, we believe that it will be more complementary than competitive. And while people do have a limited amount of free time that they can devote to these types of games, we do think that people will want to check out the new and the old. We think the new one is very compelling and is going to capture a lot of hearts and minds and will be very successful for us. But we also believe that many people will continue playing World of Warcraft because they have such a huge collection of friends and community. We have taken some of our most experienced developers and put them on this project. We believe we have a dream team. These are the people who made WoW a success. We are going to blow people’s minds.\nVB: That’s a tease. It sounds like you can take some lessons from seven years of WoW and apply them to a new game?\nPS: Yeah (Blizzard CEO) Mike Morhaime talked about this. We really try to learn from what we’ve done in the past. When you architect the game, you architect it with the vision that exists at that time. We’ve got some vision for what is coming and how gaming has evolved. Some of the new things that maybe we would want to do, we can’t do as elegantly because of the way we’ve architected the old game. It’s easier if we are starting fresh. So that being said, we are doing that sort of thing and it’s also not the same game. It’s a different game, so we do feel it’s important to our developers as well as the players for us to deliver something else that can expand their gaming experiences.\nVB: And what’s your observation about social games and mobile games and how fast they have come into the center of the discussion?\nPS: They are obviously very hot, and I personally I am very geeked up about it. I have an iPhone. I’ve got an iPad. I am very engaged in playing those games. I dig them, I’ve got a lot of them. My kids are playing and they both have iPads. Both my sons and my daughter have an iPod Touch. So they all are playing games and they are sharing their gaming time between a PC and Xbox 360. Their tablets are handhelds. They play on the DS. The games are getting cooler and are so much more easily accessible because you can download from the App Store and they don’t have to get mom and dad to take them to a store. I am stoked about it because I rarely have long periods of time to play. I have a lot of 5 minute chunks here and there. Hey, I think if I’ve got five minutes and no kids are bugging me and no one is calling me to do something, I will often look at my emails. If I don’t want to do that, I might play a little Angry Birds. I mean it just happens.\nVB: So you play when you are in the bathroom?\nPS: Well, I can, I don’t know about you, but….\nVB: Do you think that the back-end server infrastructure that Blizzard has built is now a competitive advantage?\nPS: I personally believe that our back-end infrastructure gives us a competitive advantage over other MMO companies. We have the biggest single audience of subscription gamers. It’s very complex and there are thousands of systems that support us.\nIf you talk to certain hardware manufacturers that we use, they will tell you that we push the hardest. We push more than any other company or any other industry when it comes to making our servers produce. We push for the technical advances for server and blade architectures. We have the numbers that justify pushing hard on the edge of technology.\nWhen I see a new company, and they talk about a cool-looking game, I think about how they are going to operate it. People forget that with Battle.net, we developed the world’s largest free online gaming network starting in 1996 for StarCraft. We learned that you have to do the right thing for your customers when you make decisions about infrastructure.\nThere are no other companies that have had that experience. We have a lot of experience dealing with people around the world, millions of players simultaneously. It is non trivial. Some companies launch their games and often lose entire days of downtime because they don’t have the experience. We are able to launch on a worldwide basis when we have a new game. We do that fearlessly.",

        "original": "Google’s Home Hub is a great way to keep tabs on your smart home.\nWhen the Google Home Hub ($149) arrived on our desk, we were surprised. This tiny little box can’t be it, we thought. Smart displays (smart speakers with built-in voice assistants like Google Assistant or Alexa) are supposed to have big screens, big footprints, and lots of bells and whistles — right?\nGoogle’s Home Hub has other ideas, and though it’s tiny, it has some powerful features that make it mighty under the hood. In a way, its simple approach is a refreshing take on the smart display — but it also feels watered down.\nAt just over 4.5 inches tall, the Google Home Hub is comparatively small, with a seven-inch portrait-style screen attached to an oval fabric stand on the back. Unlike its competition, the hulking Amazon Echo Show — which features a ten-inch screen and a four-inch base — the Home Hub takes up almost no room at all, and can sit anywhere without taking up much space. That makes it easy to fit in many parts of your home.\nUnlike other smart displays, the Home Hub lacks a camera of any kind, which is either a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you feel about your privacy and the lack of ability to video chat. The only buttons on the outside of the Hub are volume up/down and mic on/off.\nWhen placed next to the Echo Show and the Lenovo Smart Display (another smart speaker with a screen powered by Google Assistant), the difference in size is like comparing a tablet to a smartphone. While the Home Hub’s small size makes it more versatile — most smart displays are designed for primary use in the kitchen — it feels like a missed opportunity, given the device comes with six months of free YouTube Premium. The screen is too small to watch for an extended amount of time.\nHowever, the Home Hub works as a digital photo frame. If you use Google Photos you can connect your albums to the device during set up and have photos of your choice rotating throughout the day. We loved this feature and found some long-lost gems in our collection.\nA feature called Ambient EQ automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen so that the device blends into the room. You can manually adjust the brightness as well. We also appreciate Interpreter Mode, a feature that allows you to communicate with people in different languages.\nWe love how easy Google Home makes it to get devices set up. The Home Hub is no different — plug it in, open the Google Home app, and follow simple instructions on both screens to get started. Depending on whether you’re already plugged into the Google Home ecosystem, you’ll have more steps to take.\nFor example, the app will ask whether you want to set up Voice Match, which automatically recognizes your voice and give you and others in the household tailored responses. You also will want to connect to any streaming music and video services (you’ll need to log into your accounts for this) and smart home devices, which is all self-explanatory in the recently-overhauled Google Home app.\nIn our case, we already have a Google Home device in our test home, which made the setup process as easy as plugging in the device.\nThe Google Home Hub is at its finest when connected to a smart home. We like the pull-down screen that gives us instant access and control over smart home devices we have connected. There’s still the option to use your voice to control lights, plugs, locks, cameras and more (“Hey Google, turn on the downstairs lamp”), but the pull-down menu features a nicely organized list of connected devices, and the status of each.\nYou can tap “lights,” for instance, and get a list of connected lights and their status, or can choose by room to see a list of all the devices connected. You’ll need just minutes to organize your devices in each room. It’s an easy-to-use control panel for all your connected devices.\nHey Google, what’s my morning commute look like?\nGoogle Assistant works the same no matter what smart speaker you have, but Home Hub compliments your interactions with by adding a screen. For example, if you want to a video tutorial on how to hard boil eggs, simply say, “Hey Google, show me videos on how to hard boil eggs” and then you can use the touchscreen to choose from results that pop up. With a Google Home Mini or Google Home, which doesn’t have a screen, Google Assistant will simply read the instructions. That’s not as helpful if you’re a visual learner.\nThe Hub is a nifty way to get a snapshot of what’s happening in the home.\nThere’re other uses, too. If you have a Nest camera (or any compatible camera) connected to the device, you can view footage from it on the Google Home Hub. We have two Nest cams in our test house and found viewing footage from them was a seamless process.\nYou can also answer the Nest Hello video doorbell on the Home Hub, complete with two-way communication. While we don’t have a Nest Hello in our smart home, we certainly like the idea of having an extra place to monitor movement at the front door.\nBecause Google Assistant is already connected to our Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Maps, and other Google platforms, integration with what we’re already using is seamless. For example, when we set up the Home Hub, Google already knew us based on our account and our usage, and therefore calendar reminders and the morning commute outlook automatically popped up on our home screen. If that creeps you out, you can customize what you see.\nWhile the Google Home Hub works as, well, a home hub, it has flaws. Sound quality is the biggest disappointment. It lands between the Google Home and the Google Home Mini, and that’s not stellar. It’s not loud and lacks the bass and treble to make listening an enjoyable experience.\nIts speaker isn’t loud and lacks the bass to make listening enjoyable.\nBy contrast, the Amazon Echo Spot and the Echo Show feature louder sound and a richer musical experience. We understand and respect that Google wanted to keep the device simple, small, and affordable, but not providing at least adequate sound is a missed opportunity. Audiophiles, or anyone who appreciates halfway decent sound, will need to reach for another speaker.\nThe other drawback, which we alluded to before, is the screen. It’s just slightly smaller than we’d like. Even an inch would help us enjoy the YouTube videos we can’t access on Amazon devices due to an ongoing feud between the two tech giants.\nGoogle offers a one-year limited materials and workmanship warranty on the Google Home Hub.\nThere’s a lot to like about the Google Home Hub. We appreciate the focus on smart home control, the pull-down control panel, and the digital photo frame capabilities. We also appreciate the lack of a camera for those concerned about privacy.\nWe came away wishing Google made the screen, and sound, a priority. With free YouTube Premium, it feels like a missed opportunity. Still, at $149, this is an affordable price to pay for better smart home control.\nIt depends on what you’re looking for. If you’re looking for an introductory smart speaker without a screen, take a look at the Google Home Mini ($49) or Amazon Echo Dot ($50). Either will do the trick. If you need the screen for the kitchen and love Google Assistant, the Lenovo Smart Display, available in both 8- and 10-inch sizes ($199 and $249), is the best choice.\nIf you’re interested in Amazon Alexa voice technology, the Echo Show is a great option, with a built-in smart home hub, a 10-inch screen, and excellent sound. If you’re looking for a smart display that’s smaller, consider the Echo Spot ($130), which is meant for a nightstand or desk.\nYou can assume that Google and Google Assistant are here to stay. Google will continue to update and improve Google Assistant technology through firmware updates. We can’t guarantee that Google won’t introduce another smart display down the road, though.\nIf you’re looking for an affordable Google Assistant powered smart screen that focuses on smart home control, then buy the Google Home Hub. If you’re seeking a bigger screen with better sound, look at the Lenovo Smart Display or Amazon Echo Show instead.\nUpdated March 22, 2019 to add Interpreter Mode.",

And if you're dying to get a peek at the film, you can pre-order, via iTunes, the whole album ahead of its Dec. 9 release, and to tide you over, they'll give a free download of Reznor's cover of \"The Immigrant Song,\" with vocals by Karen O, and an 8-minute super trailer—which we have to admit has our fingers twitching a bit.\nBut if you're depressed enough to want to hear the album in all its glory, you may be in a deep enough funk to forgo the $11.99 digital download, and head straight for the $300 deluxe edition, which justifies its bananas price tag with vinyl autographs, limited edition artwork, razor-blade USB drives and other goodies. But there's a catch—if you order today, the thing doesn’t even ship until Feb. 6, some six weeks after the film hits theaters.\nWhile this whole thing sets our head to shaking, we have to admit that we've dropped greater sums on equally frivolous things. And for the average Trent Reznor fan—who is now over 35--$300 probably isn’t a budget buster.",

The top job at the Federal Aviation Administration has been open for 14 months. Enforcement fines against major U.S. airlines have dropped 88 percent in the past two years, even as three-hour tarmac delays have more than doubled.\nThe Transportation Department under Secretary Elaine Chao has seemingly been delayed on a number of issues important to travelers. Even with airlines begging for rules on emotional-support animals, and both Republicans and Democrats expressing concerns about swollen fees, shrunken seating and punitive airline policies, the DOT has been loath to issue new regulations.\nNow Ms. Chao’s department, which includes the FAA, faces its toughest regulatory challenge: safety concerns on the Boeing 737 MAX. Two fatal crashes of the new airplane in the past five months have led several nations and some airlines to ground the jet.\nSo far, the FAA, siding with Boeing and U.S. airlines, says the plane is safe and a software fix is coming by the end of April.\nMeanwhile, the above mentioned Mitch McConnell is hard at work making sure that the body he heads, the Senate, doesn’t produce enough votes to override the certain veto that President Trump will issue for a resolution condemning his declaration of a national emergency on the border and his redirection of funds to building a border wall that Congress specifically refused to authorize. Never mind Article I of the Constitution, which gives Congress sole authority to permit the spending of federal dollars. If Trump blows past the Constitution, McConnell’s idea of the proper congressional response is to sit in quiet repose.\nIt’s not hard to imagine the nightly pillow talk between McConnell and Chao.\nMitch: What’d you do today, hon?\nElaine: Nothing.

Another episode gets a little competitive, as Shockey and Brent wager over a bass-fishing excursion at Jordan Lake. In yet another episode, Shockey tells Brent that they’re going on a hike, but it’s really a “wilderness yoga” date in Boone. Every episode — they run about 12-15 minutes in length — includes a bit of history about the place they’re visiting.\nShockey and Brent are both originally from Canada, but make their home near Raleigh because Brent, now a commercial real estate broker, fell in love with the area during his time playing for the Carolina Hurricanes.\nShockey insists the show isn’t just for those who already embrace camping, hiking and fishing. She wants to make the city mice among us feel just as comfortable in nature as the country mice do.\nIt also helps that no matter what they’re doing, Shockey and Brent seem to be having fun. Even when Brent’s comfort level is tested (watch Shockey try to kiss him on camera at Falls Lake), you can tell they’re having a good time. Maybe that will make viewers more inclined to get outside and find adventure.\nBut for those who are reluctant, Shockey said it might be easier to take baby steps into the great outdoors.\nShockey isn’t overbearing, but she’s passionate about the outdoors lifestyle and how healthy it is for families, so her “just do it — but have fun” attitude comes through.\n“A lot of people find excuses for why they can’t get outdoors — new mom or new job or XYZ.

        "original": "The Army last week kicked off a billion-dollar-plus project to modernize and eventually privatize key elements of its wholesale logistics system, which supplies troops with everything from helmets to helicopters.\nThe Wholesale Logistics Modernization Program (WLMP), which includes a $9 billion inventory managed by the Army Materiel Command's Communications-Electronics Command (Cecom), Fort Monmouth, N.J., goes far beyond developing new automation systems, according to Maj. Gen. Norman Williams, deputy chief of staff for logistics at AMC. Williams said in a recent speech that the Army needs \"a revolution in military logistics\" because top Army leadership \"began to realize several years ago that the way we conducted business, and especially logistical business, was not keeping pace with commercial practices.\"\nCurrently, the Army relies on what Williams characterized as \"a mass-based logistics system\" consisting of a large inventory of parts and systems required to satisfy the Army's former \"just-in-case\" mission requirements. The Army wants to use WLMP to switch to what Williams called \"a distribution-based system— one that relies on velocity instead of mass.\"\nThomas Michelli, former commander of the Army Information Systems Activity at Fort Monmouth and now a consultant, described this approach as \"the just-in-time delivery\" system used so well by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. as well as other commercial companies.\nThe request for information for WLMP released by Cecom puts adoption of the best commercial practices at the top of its requirements and emphasized that the Army wants to use proven commercial methods and systems without having to adapt them to its needs.\nNew information technology systems will play a key role in the WLMP program, according to A. David Mills, principal deputy for logistics at AMC. The Army's current wholesale logistics management system consists of the Commodity Standard System and the Standard Depot System and associated applications. The two systems run at Defense Department megacenters operated by the Defense Information Systems Agency and are supported by Central Design Activities (CDAs)— which design software— in St. Louis and in Chambersburg, Pa.\nBoth of these systems, Mills said, \"were put in [in] the early 1970s, and all the state-of-the-art capabilities [developed over the past two decades] have [passed] us by.\"\nAMC intends to use WLMP to upgrade these systems by privatizing the logistics software support functions. Another key component of the RFI asks potential contractors to describe how they would provide for the continued employment of the personnel working at the two CDAs. AMC also wants bidders to assess the future role of the DISA megacenters in the WLMP, asking them to present scenarios ranging from a retention of the status quo to a contractor-operated system to a partnership between DISA and a contractor.\nMichelli estimated that the Army spends about $110 million a year on logistics IT and would like to see costs pared. But, Michelli added, \"the real money in this contract is in helping the Army whittle down its inventory.\"\nCecom has put WLMP on a fast-track schedule, with responses to the RFI due March 23 and a draft request for proposals planned for release in April. Cecom anticipates that it will end up with three bidders. Industry sources expect Boeing Computer Services Inc., Electronic Data Systems Corp., Lockheed Martin Corp., Raytheon Corp. and TRW Inc. to respond to the RFI.",

        "original": "Boris Pasternak book cover by Yves Berger.Screenshot.\nBoris Leonidovich Pasternak was born in Moscow. His father, Leonid Pasternak, who claimed descent from the 15th-century Portuguese-Jewish banker and philosopher Isaac Abarbanel, was a successful painter and art professor. Boris’ mother, the former Rosa Kaufman, the daughter of an Odessa industrialist, was herself a concert pianist.\nBoris was gifted musically: By age 13, he was composing music. He began piano studies at the Moscow Conservatory, but left abruptly in 1910 to enroll in philosophy studies at the University of Marburg, in Germany. It was there that he began writing poetry seriously.\nDuring World War I, Pasternak lived in Vsevolodovo Vilve, in the Ural mountains, where he worked as a private tutor and as a laborer in a chemical factory. When the Bolsheviks took power toward the end of the war, the rest of Pasternak’s family left Russia, but he supported the revolution, and remained behind.\nIn Russia, Pasternak was known principally as a poet. His first collection, “My Sister, Life” (1921), was innovative and influential enough to have been said to have revolutionized Russian poetry. But in the decades that followed, Pasternak made an ongoing effort to simplify his poems to make them more accessible to a larger public. This in turn angered his early admirers, many of whom were by then living in exile outside the Soviet Union.\nLike other Russian artists, Pasternak’s life and career were played out on thin ice. They were always in danger of offending the Communist regime, often for unpredictable reasons. This was especially true during the reign of Joseph Stalin.\nThe plot of “Dr. Zhivago” (which served as the basis for a lavish 1965 film, starring Omar Sharif and Julie Christie) does not parallel Pasternak’s life story, but thematically, it is concerned with the themes that preoccupied Pasternak.\nIts title character is a young physician caught up in the chaos and violence of World War I and the Russian Civil War that followed, as well as torn between several women and between his belief in both love and loyalty.\nPasternak himself, who was denounced and repudiated in his homeland after sending “Dr. Zhivago” abroad for publication, died from lung cancer on May 30, 1960. Only in 1988 did the regime permit the book’s publication in the USSR, and only the following year could his son Yevgenii journey to Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, which his father had been forced to turn down three decades earlier.",

And the storybook ending the Vegas Golden Knights had desperately hoped for became a story of another kind for the Washington Capitals.\nTwo goals in the third period gave the Caps their first Stanley Cup title, ending 43 years of futility and sending a surprisingly large contingent of red-clad Washington fans into a frenzy. They stood and cheered as the Caps passed the Stanley Cup around, enjoying a scene that up to now no Las Vegas tourist had ever imagined.\nA few minutes earlier, thousands of Knights fans were on their feet cheering for their team. The game was over, but \"Go Knights Go\" reverberated through the arena on the Las Vegas Strip.\nBoth teams had something to celebrate. But only Washington would be drinking out of the Stanley Cup.\n\"When you get this close to the cup it's hard,\" Vegas goalie Marc-Andre Fleury said. \"It doesn't happen too often. It's very disappointing.\"\nAn inaugural season like no other ended on a bittersweet note for an expansion team like no other. The first major sports team in this gambling city bucked the odds until the end, but in the end this was Washington's championship to win.\nIt was the Caps who won every playoff series coming from behind. It was the Caps who found a way to win in the third period when things seemed to be going the Knights way.\n\"We got angry and mean,\" Washington coach Barry Trotz said. \"Even when they got an extra timeout when the clock broke our guys were like, we got this. There's not a chance they will score.\"\nIt was the Knights, though, who bonded with a city and thrilled fans who before October began knew little more about hockey than it was the fastest game on ice.\nThey played into June, this collection of Golden Misfits, something no one could have imagined for a team that barely had any players a year ago. The temperature outside was close to 100 degrees for Game 5 but hockey worked in the desert and it worked in a city where you don't have to go far to place a bet on the team.\nAnd the bet is that this is a franchise that won't have to wait 43 years to raise a Stanley Cup of its own.\n\"We came up short but I'm sure in a few days we'll come up with a lot of positives about the season,\" defenseman Deryk Engelland said. \"Right now it's the worst feeling ever. You never want to lose any game, but especially at this point.\"\nA season that began somberly in the wake of the massacre of 58 people just down the street from the T-Mobile Arena ended 102 games later with a community continuing to heal and a team that far exceeded expectations on and off the ice.\nIt was Engelland who stood before the crowd at the first home game and told them, \"We are Vegas strong,\" a message that carried over on the ice. The Knights won their division, and were 12-3 in the playoffs coming into the Final, confounding the hockey experts at every turn.\nWhen they won the first game of the series it looked like the tale of an expansion team and its city would soar to new levels. But the Caps came back to win four straight, including the 4-3 win that capped off their own improbable run.\n\"No one gave us a chance from the start,\" said forward David Perron. \"I thought when I got picked in the draft that Vegas would be a fun place to be but the team wouldn't do much. It's been a great ride.\"\nWhile the Capitals were enjoying a lengthy postgame celebration on the ice, the Knights filtered through a somber locker room, talking softly about great times and a painful ending. On the verge of doing something historic, they lost their way and the price to pay for it was another team passing the Cup around on their ice.\n\"It was a phenomenal year and in a couple days we'll think about that,\" Knights coach Gerard Gallant said. \"Every day was fun for us.\"\nA magical season, yes. But it also won't be long before the reality sinks in that teams just don't get to the Stanley Cup Final every year.\nAll the Knights had to do was look at the team celebrating on the ice to understand that.",

        "original": "Investors flock to master limited partnerships because of their lucrative distributions, but which MLPs have the most consistent payouts over time? Here’s what you need to know.\nOver the past five months, investors who follow master limited partnerships have watched two of them cut their distributions in a big way. Eagle Rock Energy Partners did it at the end of October, and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners did it earlier this week. It's the cardinal sin for MLPs, and two cuts in less than six months means that many MLP investors are suddenly taking a long look at their holdings.\nRest assured there are still rock-solid MLPs out there, and today we're going to look at four of them that have increased their distributions every quarter for at least eight straight years: Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), Holly Energy Partners (NYSE:HEP), Sunoco Logistics Partners (NYSE:SXL), and Genesis Energy (NYSE:GEL).\nThe gray column is especially significant in this chart. It indicates our last recession, a period when even the strongest MLPs held their distributions flat, or cut them, because of the economic environment. Not these four stars, though -- there's nothing but increases across the board.\nOf course, consistently increasing distributions are all well and good, as long as the MLP is generating enough cash to actually cover them. If it isn't, we're likely to see some trouble down the road. That's why the other important metric to note when it comes to distributions is the coverage ratio.\nNote that neither Holly Energy Partners or Genesis Energy have reported their fourth-quarter results yet, so their coverage ratio is only good through the first three quarters of 2013. Regardless, each of these MLPs passes this test as well, further supporting the notion that they are built to last.\nThese are not the only factors to consider before actually investing in a master limited partnership, but they do give you some sense of how strong an MLP is from a mile up. As always, if you do plan to invest in one of these vehicles, make sure ample research is part of your process.",

Is it bad that someone could use it to train a facial recognition algorithm? Not necessarily,” Ms O’Neill said on Twitter, noting that such technology could be used to find missing children.\nA number of technology companies, including Facebook and Amazon, have been criticised about the privacy implications of facial recognition technology.\nInstagram and Twitter have not yet responded to a request for comment.\nThe obvious rebuttal to Ms O’Neill’s musings is that Facebook already has a troves of photos of each user over the years, which it does use to develop facial recognition technology.\nBut as she points out, it is difficult for the company to know exactly when some of the older photos were taken.\nSure, you could mine Facebook for profile pictures and look at posting dates or EXIF data. But that's a lot of noise; it'd help if you had a clean then-and-now. What's more, the photo posting date and even EXIF data wouldn't always be reliable for when the pic was actually taken.\nAlthough Ms O’Neill said that facial recognition technology will likely be most useful for targeted advertising, she emphasised in several follow-up tweets that users should remain vigilant with what they share, regardless of the social platform.\n“The broader message, removed from the specifics of any one meme or even any one social platform, is that humans are the richest data sources for most of the technology emerging in the world. We should know this, and proceed with due diligence and sophistication,” she wrote in an opinion piece for Wired on the meme.",

        "original": "If you were a learning entrepreneur, you would consider school part of your \"balanced portfolio\" of learning experiences, but oneand only onevenue for learning some kinds of things. If you were a learning entrepreneur, you would craft a lifelong learning plan that would help you chart your cognitive, social, and practical learning goals over your lifespan. (These goals would change a lot, but you'd still have a view of them year to year.) If you were a learning entrepreneur, you would see yourself as the manager of your own learningauthorized to use hundreds of different tools to get the information and skills you need, and you'd know how and when to ask for help. If you were a learning entrepreneur, you would understand the importance of finding mentors and key supporters to challenge you to excel at what you're doing, and you would encourage others to step up into their own learning. If you were a learning entrepreneur, you would think of every day as an exciting opportunity to learn something.\nAre you a learning entrepreneur? Does your school allow you to be a learning entrepreneur? Does the classroom you're in encourage kids to be entrepreneurs of their own learning? Do you think of your learning as one of the most vital and important aspects of your life? Are you the \"owner\" of your own learning?\nSteve Mariotti, the founder and president of the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurshipan organization that teaches business entrepreneurial skills to kids who are not wealthy and do not go to fancy schoolssays the power of entrepreneurship is that it challenges kids to be \"owners\" instead of outsiders, responsible risk-takers instead of passive recipients. Since many conventional schools and traditional instruction still reward passivity and compliance as well as encourage kids to accept someone else's evaluation of them, there is tremendous educational value in owning your own learning. When you own something, you are its creator. You are responsible, and your rewards are commensurate with the risks you are willing to take, and the effort you are willing to make.\nAs many edu-tech experts point out, education is increasingly, inevitably, and inexorably moving away from this thing we call \"school.\" As dozens of books, social media philosophers, and everyday folks have discovered, the institution is facing increasing challenges to its power to define valuable knowledge, to purvey specific content, and to determine how the student learns. Anya Kamenetz notes in DIY U, \"Changing education makes people really, really nervous. In a shakeup, the current elites have the most to lose.\" Whether you think this separation of learning from school is a fabulous new world or a frightening turn toward social chaos and intellectual superficiality, the movement is happening right nowduring every day in every school on every wikispace, edmodo platform, friend request, and tweet.\nAs education becomes more inflexibile, redundant, and unwilling to reflect on the meaning of its current favored practices, students need to become learning entrepreneurs. They need to begin to write their own business plans for their learning, to analyze their learning lives, and to learn the skills of risk-taking and reinvention. Children at the K-12 level need new models for thinking about learning in their livesmodels that are lifelong and emphasize the need for flexibility and creativity; models that embolden the learner to be more risk-taking and self-authorized; models that challenge children to discover and model best practices and important bodies of knowledge, but do not see acquisition of them as the purpose of education.\nBeing a learning entrepreneur combines some of the freedom of \"unschooling\" with the intention of business planning. Learning entrepreneurs ask: \"What is my goal? What are my unit costs? What raw materials or skills do I need to achieve my plan?\" Unlike one-on-one learning or full-time virtual learning, becoming a learning entrepreneur is a mindshifta movement toward collective engagement in learning that is not attached to a particular institution, set of courses, or authorizing body.\nWhere are these learning-entrepreneurship models developing? Everywhere. The Anytime, Anywhere Learning Foundation profiles schools all over the world that focus on the development of passionate learning. \"All that matters is what the experience becomes for students,\" proclaimed the AALF. Or as iconic entrepreneur Richard Branson recently said, \"My biggest motivation? Just to keep challenging myself. I see life almost like one long university education that I never had. Every day, I'm learning something new.\"\nOur minds, our fears, and our lack of prevalent modelsnot the absence of tools to achieve the visionare our greatest barriers to learning entrepreneurship. Who are the greatest learners you have known in your life? What made them great? What do you admire about them as learners? How can you adapt these qualities to your own learning projects?\nAs we work toward describing the howand the whatof learning entrepreneurship, lowering students', parents', and teachers' barriers to the concept is the greatest hurdle.\nKirsten Olson, Ed.D., a consultant and educational activist, is the the author of Wounded By School: Recapturing the Joy in Learning and Standing Up to Old School Culture. She is currently writing a book on passionate learning and learning entrepreneurship.",

He was executed by hanging on Monday following his conviction by the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal (SICT), which was set up to deal with crimes committed by the former government of Saddam Hussain. Amnesty International has repeatedly expressed concerns about trial proceedings at the SICT, which have been undermined by political interference and fall far short of international standards for fair trial. \"Despite the enormity of the crimes of which Al Hassan al-Majid was convicted, we deplore his execution and consider it a step backwards,\" said Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Director. \"In fact, it is only the latest of a mounting number of executions, some of whom did not receive fair trials, in gross violation of human rights.\" The execution of al-Majeed comes at a time when the Iraqi authorities are making increased use of the death penalty. Currently, more than 900 prisoners are reported to be on death row, many of whom could be executed in the near future. Many were sentenced to death by the Central Criminal Court of Iraq after trials that failed to conform to international standards of fair trial. Al-Majid had been sentenced to death for genocide and crimes against humanity in three previous trials before the SICT. \"The execution of Al Hassan al-Majid was long expected and, no doubt, many people who suffered because of the crimes of which he was found guilty will see it as bringing to a close a very sad, a very bad, chapter in Iraq's history,\" said Malcolm Smart. \"However, all executions brutalize society and in Iraq, where killing has become the order of the day, the time has come to say 'Enough!'\"",

        "original": "It should be no surprise that in India, the cow and politics go hand in hand.\nThe Sangh Parivar's first move to mobilise the 'masses' came through the anti-cow slaughter movement of 1966.\nThe vehicle was the then newly created Vishwa Hindu Parishad. But, the movement did not yield any political dividend, despite the unexpected, or really unanticipated, attack on Parliament in 1967 by thousands of sadhus demanding a ban on cow slaughter.\nIn recent times we have been once again witnessing an effort to use the gentle bovine as a political vehicle by the Bharatiya Janata Party.\nLast month, the party's manifestos for the state assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand featured issues relating to the cow.\nLast week the UP election manifesto of the BJP promised a free cow for every below poverty line (BPL) family.\nAs Mail Today correspondent Piyush Srivastava pointed out, this would involve, at a minimum, a cost of Rs 56,000 crore to the state exchequer, since there are 5.60 crore BPL families in the state, and the going rate for cows ranges from Rs 10,000-Rs 20,000.\nThat will be approximately 33 per cent of the total state budget (Rs 1,69,416 crore in 2011-12).\nAnd the BJP is offering an additional subsidy of Rs 750 per month for a cow and Rs 500 for a buffalo to small and medium farmers which would add another Rs 17,000 crore to the bill.\nAccording to the National Sample Survey Organisation, 43 per cent of the rural households in the state are landless.\nNo doubt most of them belong to the BPL category who are barely able to feed and shelter themselves; now they will also get a cow to shelter and to feed. Not to be outdone, the party's Uttarakhand unit's manifesto came up with even more far-reaching proposals.\nIf reelected, the BJP would encourage the production of filtered Gau Mootra (cow's urine) in the state.\nBesides the usual development issues, the manifesto flagged the promotion of cow products and cow reverence in the state.\nAs the State unit in-charge and national general secretary Thawarchand Gehlot explained, cow's urine would be filtered and cleaned to produce a drink called 'ark' which would have various benefits including curing cancer and injuries.\nCow's urine would also form the basis of medicines for treating eye and ear diseases, as well as toothpaste, deter- gents and aftershave.\nOf course, the urine would also be used for conventional requirements such as fertilisers. There is nothing new in all this.\nThe Sangh Parivar has long promoted the use of cow's urine and dung as medicine.\nIn 2010, two leading newspapers reported that an institution which was affiliated to the Rashtriya Swyamsevak Sangh had got a US patent for an anti-cancer drug extracted from cow's urine.\nApparently the institution, Go Vigyan Anusandhan Kendra, had earlier received patents for other 'bio' enhancers and anti-cancer drugs. The item also noted that the 'drug' had been tested on three patients, hardly the norm for clinical trials.\nA hilarious sidelight to this is that the Parivar kooks claim that the virtues of the cow are limited to Indian breeds.\nSome claim that the milk of foreign hybrids may even be toxic.\nIn a 'learned' article written in the Sangh Parivar journal Organiser in August 2009, Vaidya Kulamarva Jayakrishna laid out the various advantages of cow's milk-it was nutritive, good for the eyes, brain and heart, it promoted immunity and could alleviate a variety of illnesses.\nCow slaughter and cow protection have been a vehicle of the Hindutva movement from the outset.\nPrior to the use of the Babri Masjid for the Ram Temple agitation, the Parivar had hoped to use an agitation calling for the ban of cow slaughter as its political vehicle.\nThis issue is still doing the rounds. In December, Madhya Pradesh's new anticow slaughter bill received presidential assent. Under the new bill, the existing anti-cow slaughter law was reinforced by enhancing the punishment for killing cows and transporting beef to up to seven years' imprisonment.\nThe Act also gave officials draconian powers of search and arrest and, worse, put the burden of proof on the accused. Immediately after the bill became law, there were a spate of attacks on the Muslim community by Bajrang Dal activists.\nThis was not unexpected, since the purpose of the law was, indeed, as much to harass them as to promote 'cow reverence' as a means of consolidating the Hindu community behind the BJP.\nMr Chouhan is a canny and able chief minister.\nSignificantly, what his bill did was to amend an Act penalising cow slaughter passed when Uma Bharti was the chief minister.\nHe is probably using the issue to cement his position with the kooks who dominate the higher echelons of the Sangh Parivar. With Modi's PM candidacy running into a roadblock of opposition, Chouhan is clearly positioning himself as an alternative. Pasts Hindus do not actually worship the cow.\nThe bovine, however, has had a major role in Indian mythology, religious ritual, sentiment and everyday life. The five products of milk, curd, ghee, urine and dung form part of religious ritual.\nThere is no revulsion to the urine or the dung of a cow. On the other hand, Indians will swear by the virtues of ghee and the value of milk and curd in their diet. Poets sing of the beauty of godhuli, the sight of the evening sun's rays piercing the dust raised by cows coming back home from pasture.\nThe dung of the cow is mixed with straw to make patties which are the basic fuel in many households, and dung is also mixed with clay and used to coat the plaster of the walls of a mud-shack.\nWhen I was a child living in Almora, in the 1950s, the grandmothers of the house would often sprinkle cow's urine on the sheets soiled by bed-wetting children.\nThey said that it was the best thing available for removing the bad odour which would not go away with an ordinary washing. It was a primitive remedy, but life was like that-no electricity, little or no milk, eggs, sugar, or antibiotics, even for middle class families.\nGiven the semi-literate and cynical plane upon which politics operates in this country, it would be useless to argue that the role of the cow has actually evolved over time and that one of the most sacred texts of the Hindus, the Rig Veda, even speaks of cow sacrifice and beef eating.\nI can understand why my grandmothers did what they did.\nThe burden of tradition was heavy on them. In a primitive economy, the cow did play a big role in the lives of ordinary folk.\nReligion sanctified it and practice, such as the use of cow dung for fuel, cemented it. Cows remain an important part of Indian life even today, but not on the plane that the Parivar wants them to be.\nBut my memories are of an era when smallpox and TB were big killers, and penicillin had just about arrived in India; a lot has changed since.\nBut it would be worthwhile exploring just what it is that is impelling the BJP to hark back to that era and beyond in its quest for political moksha.",

The result is experience that is controlled through intuitive motions: touch, swipe, and pinch.\nFrom the get go, former Kojima Productions dev Ryan Payton, who recently set up his own studio Camouflaj, challenged his team at Logan to come up with gameplay that did not revolve around killing. \"In a very organic way, the gameplay shifted towards stealth,\" Payton recently told Kotaku. \"This initially worried me because I didn't want people to think that the game was paying homage to Metal Gear.\"\nInstead, the resulting concept for République seems to owe more to the original Resident Evil and the Parasite Eve games—hence why Payton is calling it \"stealth survival\".\nSure, Metal Gear is an influence—give years of your life to a franchise and influences will carry over—but Payton and Logan were interested in how they could also incorporate modern games like Portal and Dark Souls as well as novels like Brave New World, We, and 1984 to create a stealth experience like you've never played before.\nRépublique is currently in its proof of concept phase. It's currently for iOS, and a playable demo exists, but it's still early in the title's life. Savings, generosity, and sheer sweat have funded the title this far, and a Kickstarter campaign will launch to help finish it.\n\"In a very organic way, the gameplay shifted towards stealth.\"\nWhile Payton has several high profile games under his belt, this is the first title Logan has developed. The studio has made a name for itself with inventive commercials and cinematics, but was looking to spread its wings into game development. Since the studio and Payton go back to the Metal Gear 4 days, this seemed like an ideal fit. The concept for République was originally Payton's, but Logan saw something that appealed to its sensibilities. According to Logan co-founder Alexei Tylevich, \"A dystopian sensibility is something that I normally tend to gravitate toward, and I feel that the concept behind this game is a perfect fit for Logan.\" Making a truly immersive world is something Tylevich has always wanted to do.\nPayton and Logan are aiming to make an experience that pulls them in with game play and then digs its claws into them with its ideas and characters. \"Without being preachy, the goal with République is to transport players into a world heavily inspired by the debate going on right now about SOPA, surveillance, digital rights, the Fourth Amendment...the stresses and white noise of living in a digital age,\" said Payton. \"My desire is that the game touches players on an emotional and intellectual level.\"",

        "original": "639 pages. Random House. $26.95.\nOne night in 1939 in Brooklyn, Sammy Clayman's mother ''burst into his bedroom, applied the ring and iron knuckles of her left hand to the side of his cranium, and told him to move over and make room in the bed for his cousin from Prague.'' Thus began the partnership between Sammy and Josef Kavalier, in a meeting terrifically auspicious not only for these two future comic book auteurs but for Michael Chabon, the wizard who conjured them.\nWith ''The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,'' Mr. Chabon has fashioned a big, ripe, excitingly imaginative novel and set it in the world of his grandfather, a New York City typographer at a plant where comics were printed. The book's world is also one of impending crisis, with World War II looming and Joe's Jewish parents and brother still in Czechoslovakia, from which they urged Joe to escape. With Houdini as his hero and the Holocaust on the horizon, Joe quickly becomes acclimated to America (''Do you like gum?'' ''I feel I must learn to.'') and ready to use one of its homegrown art forms as a hedge against futility, an expression of defiance, a repository of dark humor and even a weapon of war.\n''Somebody is getting hurt already,'' Joe replies, with the carefully understated gravity that permeates this story. Even when Mr. Chabon is slipping deftly from realistic narrative into wittily hyperbolic comic-book-ese, as he does to take part in the characters' bursts of creativity each time a new character is invented, the book's essential seriousness and thematic heft are never diminished.\nEspecially impressive about ''The Adventures of Kavalier & Clay'' is its success in reaching for big settings (the top of the Empire State Building), big creative leaps (''Citizen Kane'' plays a role here) and big historical relevance without strain. Early in the book, in Prague, that mighty figure of Hebrew lore, the golem, is physically made part of Joe's escape from peril. Later on, in the duo's comic book heyday, the golem becomes a prototype for their Nazi-defeating superhero.\nA thumbnail sketch on Tuesday about the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, ''The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay'' by Michael Chabon, referred incorrectly in some copies to the original surname of a title character, as did a correction in this space yesterday. (The name was also incorrect on Sept. 21 in a review of the book.) The character is Samuel Louis Klayman, not Clayton or Clayman. In the novel he changes his name to Sam Clay and is also referred to as Sammy Clay.",

        "original": "Bill Skarsgard in a scene from Netflix's \"Hemlock Grove\" Season 2. Credit: Steve Wilkie for Netflix.\nThe action-packed penultimate episode of the second season of “Hemlock Grove” was filled with attempted upir-ectomies, vargulf-ectomies and Shelley-ectomies.\nWe open with Peter (Landon Liboiron), chained up with a collar around his neck, as he gets tortured by the white-masked gang, who captured him in the previous episode. It turns out that they know about Roman’s (Bill Skarsgård)child and that Peter is hiding her!\nThis is just the beginning of another great adventure for Peter and the group. Your recap below.\nDestiny (Kaniehtiio Horn) gives a man some money to cast the vargulf out of Peter. The man tells Destiny that Peter needs to come with him for a period of time and its best she doesn’t know what’s going to happen with her cousin.\nAfter more torture, Peter finally escapes by transforming into his wolf form to loosen the chains. Once he is loose, he kills one of his captors by slamming his now unattached collar into his head. Peter drives away from the warehouse.\nHe gets a call from Destiny while driving and he tells her to meet at Roman’s. However, Roman is not able to be reached due to his latest upir-ectomy procedure.\nRoman is about to undergo his last upir-ectomy procedure but since he is worried about his child, he asks Pryce (Joel de la Fuente) if he can reschedule. The doctor advises Roman not to do so because it could have serious consequences if it is postponed any longer (See “Dr. Johann Pryce’s complicated doctor schlanguage translated” for an unnecessarily long description of this scene).\nDuring the final upir-ectomy procedure, Dr. Galina Zhelezhnova-Burdukovskaya (Shauna MacDonald) secretly injects a drug into Roman’s tubes. While we may never know what the drug was meant to do, it was most likely going to kill Roman.\nHowever, Roman gets a simple text from Peter with the words, “They know about Nadia” and that is enough for Roman to rip the tubes off of his body. The drug Galina injected never actually reaches him.\nRoman, hungry for blood, forces Galina to open the room with the box filled with bloody limbs (was there ever an actual name for this box?). He plugs one of his tubes into the machine to absorb its contents. Galina tries to stop him by attempting to inject him but she fails miserably. While it is never seen on screen, it is heavily implied that Roman killed the doctor and stuffed her in the box, as the scene is discovered by Pryce and Olivia (Famke Janssen).\nMadeline Brewer (L) and Bill Skarsgard (R) in a scene from Netflix's \"Hemlock Grove\" Season 2. Credit: Steve Wilkie for Netflix.\nAs if we didn’t already think baby Nadia was freaky enough with those hypnotic blue eyes, it turns out Roman’s child is also very intelligent. While Miranda is trying to play peek-a-boo, the baby basically says, “Screw that childish crap” when she presents blocks with her name spelled out.\nLater, Peter, Destiny and Miranda are at Roman’s place with the man who is going to perform the vargulf-ectomy (it’s appropriate to make up words like this now, right?). The man bares his chest to Peter and reveals several scratches. His own father abused him after turning on a bad moon.\nPeter, furious that Destiny would choose this moment to stage an intervention, tries to run off. When Destiny tries to grab him, Peter pushes her and realizes just how far the vargulf has got into him. Peter breaks down and cries.\nJust when you think everything will be fine, all hell breaks loose.\nAnd then our favorite butler gets shot with an arrow by a member of the white-masked gang and everyone else in the house is a target as they try to reach Nadia.\nDuring the chaos, Destiny and Miranda go upstairs to protect Nadia and the man who was going to cast the vargulf out of Peter is killed.\nWith the exception of the vargulf growing within him, Peter has other problems to worry about. During a confrontation, Peter is held by the members of the white-masked gang and is about to be decapitated.\nThen it's Roman to the rescue as he plants an axe in the back of Peter's captor.\nUpstairs, Destiny and Miranda are alone with baby Nadia. Concerned, Destiny tries to leave the room to check on Peter. When she tries to leave, she is confronted by one of the white-masked men. She then stabs him in the crotch — ouch.\nTo save Destiny’s life, Peter changes into his wolf form. Meanwhile, Roman bites one of the other members of the gang. Looks like the monsters in these gentlemen will never die.\nBut the biggest problem happens in the room holding Nadia and Miranda. The blonde leader of the group breaks through a window and aims a crossbow at Nadia.\nBut Roman’s child gets the last laugh.\nAll of a sudden, blondie’s face starts to bleed and it is heavily implied that Nadia was the one responsible.\nRoman reunites with Miranda and Nadia and Peter enters the room in his wolf form.\nThere’s only one problem: Peter can’t change back into his human form. Roman tries to get through to Peter to no avail. He then rips his friend’s jaw open and pulls the human form out of the wolf’s mouth. Peter is saved and we are left a little more grossed out.\nTo thank Leticia (Lisa Marcos) for her efforts, Norman (Dougray Scott) gives her a check worth four times as much as her asking price. But Norman has an ulterior motive and Leticia figures it out. The money was just meant as a way to distract her from Norman’s true intentions: killing Olivia.\nLeticia confronts Norman in front of Olivia’s house and tells him that the cops will grab him up and that she will definitely testify against him. After heavy persuading from Leticia, Norman eventually gives her the gun he was planning to use.\nLater, Leticia goes to Chasseur (Demore Barnes) to warn him about Norman’s plot against Leticia. Chasseur says that he can’t arrest Norman but instead arrests Leticia after realizing she trespassed into Olivia’s home to get her fingerprints.\nWhy would he arrest Leticia? He wants to get her out of the way so he can accomplish his original mission, and also make cops look like corrupt people.\nChasseur visits Norman and tells him that he wants Olivia dead just as much as he does. He confides in Norman about how Olivia killed his sister and he hopes that since Olivia trusts Norman, he can do the job.\nLater, Chasseur brings Norman into a room with a cadaver. Chasseur tells Norman that the only way you can kill an upir is through decapitation or cremation. He tells Norman that he wants Olivia to be stabbed in the heart so she can be stunned and they can torch the body.\nNorman practices stabbing the cadaver in the heart. His face looks closer to Norman Bates than it is to the kind-hearted Norman Godfrey we are used to.\nMadeleine Martin (L) and Famke Janssen (R) in a scene from Netflix's \"Hemlock Grove\" Season 2. Credit: Brooke Palmer for Netflix.\nBut wait, Olivia is changing!\nShelley (Madeleine Martin) is about to undergo her final transference into Prycilla’s body on the grounds that she gets to see her mother first. Shelley tells her mother how sorry she was for making it so hard and that she understands that Olivia was just trying to protect her.\nShelley says goodbye as she fully intends to let her mother believe she’s dead.\nLater on, Olivia lies down with Shelley and sings a lullaby as she wishes of starting over with her daughter.\nPryce once again uses his poetic and confusing language during the scene where he describes the final upir-ectomy procedure.\nCheck out the recap of the last episode here.",

I also pointed out how the Media ignored the obvious communist-like appearance of Obama campaign art and then pointed out that the Media assisted Obama's iconography by constantly showing him in pseudo-religious poses as if he were Christ-like. And to this day the Old Media has paid little notice to the communist style to Obama's poster art. But at long last the media has noticed some communist-like art in a political movement. After all this time, the Old Media is ready to castigate someone for utilizing commie art styles. Naturally it isn't Obama that the L.A. Times attacks, of course. It's Glenn Beck.\nFor the logo, three raised and clenched red fists are superimposed over the U.S. Capitol. Obviously the bloody fist represents the tea-baggers' themes of unity and resistance.\nAs I said, this little incident really shows once again how the Old Media is sold out to Obama.",

        "original": "The most absurd and wonderful perk of piloting.\nCanary Wharf, London, from a 747 on approach to Heathrow Airport.\nA pilot may acquire an affectionate awareness of a kind of punctuation or asterisking of the world, composed of the names of small places, places that almost no one other than pilots will have reason to think of regularly.\nMany geographic milestones are elevated this way because they are home to radio beacons. It’s hard not to think of older beacons, lit to help navigate, as with lighthouses, or to transmit warnings, as with the news of the sightings of the Spanish Armada, or to celebrate events such as coronations and jubilees. In the 1920s hundreds of light beacons, often placed high on mountaintops, inaugurated the first transcontinental airmail flights, from New York to San Francisco. This cross-country trail of light echoed the railroads, of course, but also the Pony Express, as pilots and planes would change en route, allowing letters to make an almost continuous journey from one coast to the other. There was even talk of a “lighted airway” across the Atlantic for dirigibles. Today, particularly in the western United States, some of the radio beacons used by modern airliners are sited just where those original light beacons once stood.\nNear the tip of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, on the ocean side, stands a beacon that is a curiosity to those walking near the beach and that shares a name, appropriately, with Marconi, the Italian engineer known as the father of radio. Beacons like this one and the plane speak to each other, like children playing Marco Polo in a pool. The plane counts the time between its call of “Marco!” and the beacon’s reply of “Polo!” and so calculates the distance between them.\nPilots can manually tune a beacon and see our distance and bearing from it, a basic, old-school check of our position. But in the background a modern aircraft is always searching for them, like a driver in an unfamiliar town constantly seeking landmarks and street signs. Beacons have only a certain range, and when the aircraft finds one, its codes may flicker to life on one of our screens, and in this way we come to know the names of many of the beacons of the world.\nIn the more remote regions of the world beacons and airports often coincide; the beacon is there because the airport is there. When such a place is surrounded by nothing else that relates to aviation, its isolation lifts it into unexpected prominence in the sky. In Greenland is the airport named Aasiaat. It is on a bay I would like to visit one day, because it bears the marvelous name familiar to armchair atlas ponderers, long-haul pilots, and almost no one else: Disko Bay. The names of many small places in the far north of Canada have the quality of making bitterly cold water sound warmer than it can ever be—Pond Inlet, Sandy Bay, Hall Beach, and Coral Harbor.\nSome beacons are in places that although famous are geographically incidental; you might not expect them to be elevated on aviation charts in a manner so independent of their historical prominence. Point Reyes is the name of a lighthouse on the Northern California coast; a beacon near it, known by the same name, features on arrivals in San Francisco. Robben Island, off Cape Town, South Africa, where Nelson Mandela was incarcerated, was a prison even in the 17th century. It’s home, too, to a beacon of the same name, which appears on charts for Cape Town’s airport and forms part of an often-used arrival pattern.\nI have a Canadian friend from a small town in interior British Columbia. When I first asked where she was from, she laughed and shook her head and said I would not know it; it was a tiny town where they didn’t close the school unless the temperature was colder than minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit. But when she said the name of this small place, Williams Lake, it was my turn to smile and say: “I know Williams Lake; I gaze on it every few months. There’s a navigation beacon there.” When I see her, if I have flown over it recently, I will tell her if it was cloudy or if I could see her hometown resting between the Rockies and the Coast Range.\nA pilot’s awareness that the whole world is possible is most acute when on standby. Sometimes these standby duties take place at airports, but often they are assigned at home, where we are required to be reachable by telephone and to be within a certain travel time of the airport. When another pilot cannot make it to work—illness, a child-care problem, a flat tire—then a standby pilot is called. Sometimes by the time I reach the airport the passengers have already boarded, the fuel and cargo are loaded, and staff are standing by the airplane’s last open door, waving their hands at an oblique angle that suggests both a greeting and the direction in which I should keep moving, through the airplane door that they will close as soon as I pass through it.\nWhen I’m on standby I have a bag permanently packed, with both winter gloves and a bathing suit amid the uniform shirts, a bag for all lands, all seasons. I’ll be at home cleaning or at the supermarket or running in the park when my phone will ring and a voice tells me that I’m bound for Bangkok or Boston or Bangalore, India. I return home, pick up my bag, and fly there.\nOccasionally I think that the more broadly you wish to experience the world, the more certain it is that you would enjoy being a pilot, even if flying itself isn’t your first love. Alfred de Musset, in a sonnet dedicated to Victor Hugo, wrote that in this “low world” you should love many things, in order to know at the end the thing you love best.\nHe lists some things we might love. He includes the sea and the blue of the heavens, and few pilots would disagree. But a pilot might also take the “low world” more literally. If you are interested in motorcycling or urban design, opera or kite surfing, hiking or languages, the whole world of these things opens to you, at least on long-haul trips, where even if you are able to fall asleep for the half day after arrival and before departure, you often have an entirely clear day or two in between. In many cities—Bangkok, Mexico City, Tokyo—cooking schools offer short courses that are popular with pilots and cabin crew, an opportunity to ground ourselves in the tastes of a new place and to do the cooking that a life of hotels and restaurants cuts us off from. Sometimes everyone at such a class works for one airline or another, sharing a few hours and a table in a far place.\nMany of the pursuits that fill our off-duty hours are aligned with the natural world. I have flown with pilots who explore botanical gardens wherever they go or put time changes to good use by rising early to photograph sunrises. If you have an interest in wildlife, you will have the opportunity to see pandas or elephants or tigers or whales where they live or to see birds in one season and continent and then later in another; to overfly their migrations and wait for them somewhere else. You might read a book about the great trees of the world and a few years later have stood under many of them in their original habitats.\nI don’t mean to diminish the many challenges of the job—the initial training costs that burden most new pilots with home mortgage–sized loans; the days and nights and holidays so far away from family and friends; the irregular schedules that make regular commitments to neighbors or local sports teams or community organizations so challenging; the permanent regimen of biannual, multiday simulator exams; the physical stresses of unpatterned night shifts, time-zone changes, and other circadian upheavals; and the knowledge that our livelihood can vanish entirely in the furrowing of a doctor’s brow during one of our regular medical checkups. Flying is work in every sense. (“The reason you fly,” admonishes the father of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, “is to eat.”) But there are few jobs, I think, whose side rewards are so varied—as wide as the whole world—and so freely determined by the individuals involved.\nOne of my own interests when I am away for work—downroute, as we say—is hiking, which seems to help with both place lag and jet lag, although whether this effect is due to the exercise or the simple act of placing my boots on the soil, I do not know.\nI’m walking in a park in South Africa; it is hot and dusty; I am here with several of the flight attendants and the pilots. The soil is red, and the sky is blue; we are sleepy, but the sun and conversation keep us awake. It was nearly freezing when we left London last night; overcast, late autumn, the anti-icers running on all the engines for takeoff. Dawn came over Botswana, and as we descended together toward Johannesburg a few hours ago, we saw this land below, this color, smoothed to perfect abstraction and running to the horizon as the sun rose on this spring morning in southern Africa. Now I’m walking on the land we crossed over. This soil gusts up in small crimson clouds with each step of mine that falls on it. A colleague points to a tree, to a weaver nest hanging from a branch; he tells me that the birds are named for their skill in making these nests.\nIt’s four days later. I’m at home, standing sleepily by the sink. The water runs over the soles of my sneakers, sweeping the African dust brightly over the stainless steel. I have to say it in my head, practically spell it out: “This is the red of the soil under the South African tree, from the morning I saw the weavers and their nests.” People become quickly accustomed to peculiar aspects of any job. I try hard to remember that this is an unusual experience of the world—to have stood on the earth there, then there on it and there, then suddenly to find myself alone on an ordinary afternoon, quietly washing it from my shoes.\nMark Vanhoenacker is a writer in New York and author of Skyfaring: A Journey With a Pilot.",

        "original": "The motion claims prosecutors did not turn over evidence that might have cleared Ulbricht until two weeks before the trial began.\nRoss Ulbricht, the convicted founder of online drug marketplace Silk Road, is seeking a new trial based on the premise that prosecutors failed to disclose evidence in a timely fashion.\nAfter hearing evidence for nearly a month, a jury in February took less than three hours to find the 30-year-old guilty of all seven charges related to computer hacking conspiracy, narcotics trafficking conspiracy, and money laundering. The virtual bazaar, which Ulbricht founded in 2011, was a haven for buyers and sellers of illegal narcotics, allowing them to conduct business without easy detection by authorities.\nIn a motion filed Friday in New York federal court, Ulbricht's attorneys argued that a new trial should be granted \"because the government failed to produce exculpatory material in a timely fashion that would have permitted the defense effective use of the material and information at trial.\" As a result, Ulbricht was denied his Fifth Amendment right to due process, they contend.\nThe motion is the latest chapter in what became one of the strangest, darkest tales of Web culture run amok in recent memory. Prosecutors said Ulbricht conceived and oversaw Silk Road operations as it grew into a $1.2 billion drug empire known by users as an Amazon of sorts for narcotics, with buyer ratings and money-back guarantees. Prosecutors and the FBI also said Ulbricht hired people over the Internet to kill those trying to extort him for cash, although there is no evidence the murders occurred.\nProsecutors contended that the former Eagle Scout was not the happy-go-lucky, yet reserved, engineer he seemed to be. They claimed that when he logged online, Ulbricht donned the moniker Dread Pirate Roberts, an alias borrowed from \"The Princess Bride\" novel and film adaptation designed to give the appearance of many conspirators and not just a single leader.\nUlbricht's attorneys argued in their motion Friday that evidence potentially proving Ulbricht's innocence was included in 5,000 pages of material turned over by prosecutors to the defense two weeks before the trial began. Among the redacted pages was exculpatory information concerning an \"alternative perpetrator,\" the motion said.\nUlbricht defense acknowledged that he was indeed the creator of the Silk Road but contended that he handed responsibility to someone else. They claimed Ulbricht became the perfect \"fall guy\" for that unnamed operator of the site.\nThe motion also suggests that investigators may have violated Ulbricht's Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure by conducting warrantless surveillance of Ulbricht's activities on Tor, the anonymous network that drug sellers and buyers used to conduct transactions.\nUlbricht, who faces up to life in prison after being convicted of being a \"kingpin\" who ran a continuing criminal enterprise, is scheduled to be sentenced May 15.",
